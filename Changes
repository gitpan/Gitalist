    - Major frontend redesign, thanks to ranguard and the web designers at
      Foxtons for making this happen.
    - Major URI overhaul, Gitalist has gone from old gitweb style CGI
      parameters to proper URIs, however the old URIs are still supported
      and will redirect appropriately (Tomas Doran).
    - With the URI overhaul also came breaking up actions into fragments
      for use with Catalyst::View::Component::SubInclude.
    - BIG BREAKING CHANGE - Gitalist::Model::GitRepos has been renamed
      Gitalist::Model::CollectionOfRepos. You need to fix your config and
      if you have actually installed Gitalist - remove the old model file.
    - Bump required version of Git::PurePerl for Encoding fixes.
    - Fix Makefile.PL to not need release deps when checking out of Git.

    - Fix tests with older versions of git.
    - Allow the model to be configured with a list of repositories rather
      then a directory containing repositories.

    - Project has been renamed Repository to correspond with normal git
      terminology.
    - Repos has been refactored into a CollectionOfRepositories role
      and two differnet concrete implementations (the Catalyst model
      chooses which type to build based on the config).
    - Remove all tabs and fix no tabs test (Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker)
    - Decode getpwuid values correctly (Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker)

     environment.
   - Add GITALIST_REPOS_DIR environment variable which will determine the
     repository path (overriding normal config) if set.
   - Change so that no default repos path is in the config when installed from

     maintained).
